0.9.9001 (development version)
------------------------------

-   The calculation of distances for diversity tests is much more
    efficient in time and space, so tests may be performed on data with
    very high counts, such as diversity of OTUs quantified via read
    counts
-   Diversity tests return class diversity_test, which has print and
    plot methods
-   Gamma accumulation functions return class gamma_accum, which has a
    plot method
-   diversity, alleleDiversityTest, alleleContrastTest, and
    alleleContrastTest3 have methods for divtable and allele_divtables
-   Lists of allele diversity tables have class allele_divtables
-   Diversity site-by-source tables have class divtable, with methods to
    convert from table, xtabs, matrix, and data.frame
-   diversity returns separate lists for diversity values calculated
    using the standard diversity calculations (q), classical corrections
    (r), and Nielsen et al. (2003 Molecular Ecology) corrections
    (q.nielsen).
-   nielsenTransform is an exported function
-   membershipPlot with fill.method = "colour" will use the RColorBrewer
    package if it is available; the default palette is "Dark2" and this
    can be changed with fill.palette. Also, "colour" is a fill.method
    synonym for "color".
-   membershipPlot will on option write the plot to a PDF file; the
    option to write to an EPS file is removed
-   membershipPlot drops the method argument along with the plotting of
    pie charts
-   The datasets granaries_2002_Qlob and granaries_2004_Qlob are
    provided, which include assignments of Quercus lobata acorns
    harvested from acorn woodpecker granaries in 2002 and 2004 to seed
    source trees.
-   Numerous functions have been renamed (e.g., pmiDiversity to
    diversity) and data structures reconfigured (e.g., the return value
    from diversity)
