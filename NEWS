0.9.9000 (development version, branch make_R_package)
-----------------------------------------------------

-   Diversity tests return class diversity_test, which has print and
    plot methods
-   Gamma accumulation functions return class gamma_accum, which has a
    plot method
-   diversity, alleleDiversityTest, alleleContrastTest, and
    alleleContrastTest3 have methods for divtable and allele_divtables
-   Lists of allele diversity tables have class allele_divtables
-   Diversity site-by-source tables have class divtable, with methods to
    convert from table, xtabs, matrix, and data.frame
-   diversity returns separate lists for diversity values calculated
    using the standard diversity calculations (q), classical corrections
    (r), and Nielsen et al. (2003 Molecular Ecology) corrections
    (q.nielsen).
-   membershipPlot with fill.method = "color" will use the RColorBrewer
    package if it is available; the default palette is "Dark2" and this
    can be changed with the fill.palette = option. Also, "colour" is a
    fill.method synonym for "color".
-   The datasets granaries_2002_Qlob and granaries_2004_Qlob are
    provided, which include assignments of Quercus lobata acorns
    harvested from acorn woodpecker granaries in 2002 and 2004 to seed
    source trees.
-   Numerous functions have been renamed (e.g., pmiDiversity to
    diversity) and data structures reconfigured (e.g., the return value
    from diversity)
