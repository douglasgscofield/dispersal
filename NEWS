0.9.9000 (development version, branch make_R_package)
-----------------------------------------------------

-   diversity returns separate lists for diversity values calculated
    using the standard diversity calculations (q), classical corrections
    (r), and Nielsen et al. (2003 Molecular Ecology) corrections
    (q.nielsen).
-   membershipPlot with fill.method = "color" will use the RColorBrewer
    package if it is available; the default palette is "Dark2" and this
    can be changed with the fill.palette = option. Also, "colour" is a
    fill.method synonym for "color".
-   Numerous functions have been renamed (e.g., pmiDiversity to
    diversity) and data structures reconfigured (e.g., the return value
    from diversity)
